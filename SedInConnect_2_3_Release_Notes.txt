SedInConnect 2.1 application and code are provided under GPL license version 2 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt)
The executable file has been created with PyInstaller (http://www.pyinstaller.org/)

Output Index of Connectivity map is printed to screen and,if target option is selected, also the distribution of IC values along with the main statistics.

File type selection has been implemented and the target rasterization process has been optimized to reflect the original feature to raster conversion.
Some minor bugs remain while using targets but they are not influencing IC map.

"guimages" and "gdal_rasterize" libraries are provided, for the other libraries please refer to the official website for the installation.
For gdal_rasterize: source: http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/16837/how-can-i-turn-a-shapefile-into-a-mask-and-calculate-the-mean

The output files have no statistics computed, in order to better visualize them in a GIS environment
we recommend to run a Build Pyramid-Calculate-statistics and use a classified view (ArcGis) or equivalent procedure for other GIS software. 

The application has been tested with files up to 4 GB, depending on the available PC memory the user should consider the maximum size raster (less then half the max memory).
For files greater than 4 GB the program needs to be modified in order to work with Big GeoTIFF.
